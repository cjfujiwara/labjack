# BigShim
This code operates the BigShim which the lattice lab uses to cancels out drifts in Earth's magnetic field.

The basic operating principle uses a [FL1-100](https://www.stefan-mayer.com/en/products/magnetometers-and-sensors/fluxgate-sensor-fl1-100.html) Flux Gate
magnetic field sensor. Some important properties
- +- 1 Gauss Sense Range
- 10 mV/mG sensitivity
- low noise
- no hysterisis

The sensor is placed around 1 meter away from the atoms with its measurements axis to be parallel with the feshbach field direction (vertical). If assume that field fluctuations in the room have a wavelength longer than 2 meters,
then any fluctuation in field at the sensor location is the same at the location of the atoms.  We built a large shim coil so that the field profile at the location of the sensor is roughly equal the field generated 
at the location of the atoms. Thus, stabilizing the magnetic field at the sensor will stabize the field at the atoms. An important factor is that the presence of any local fields such as those generated by the experiments' electromagnets
will create a bias field at the sensor location.  Thus, the field must be stabilized at a specific setpoint.  This also means that the sensor has be to be sufficnetly far away from any electromagnets so 
as not require a stabilization field outside of the 1G range of the device.
